## Database Schema

The application uses SQLite with two main tables:

- `active` - Whether the habit is active

### Health Logs Table
- `log_id` - Primary key
- `habit_id` - Foreign key to habits table
- `habit_name` - Habit name (denormalized for performance)
- `status` - Completion status (Completed, Skipped)
- `timestamp` - When the activity was logged

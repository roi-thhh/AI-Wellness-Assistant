# Final Polish - Layout and Alignment Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Summary Cards Layout ✅
**Problem:** 
- Text in summary cards was misaligned
- Labels appeared cramped and inconsistent
- Icons and text not properly positioned

**Solution:**
- Removed unnecessary HBox wrappers with icons
- Simplified card structure to VBox with direct labels
- Added proper alignment: `alignment="TOP_LEFT"` and `spacing="8"`
- Created new `.card-label` CSS class for consistent label styling
- Improved spacing between card elements

**Changes Made:**
- `DashboardView.fxml`: Simplified summary card structure
- `styles.css`: 
  - Enhanced `.summary-card` with better spacing and alignment
  - Added `.card-label` style for card headers
  - Increased `.card-value` font size to 32px for better readability
  - Added proper padding and alignment to all card elements

### 2. Section Title Spacing ✅
**Problem:**
- "Today's Habits" section title not properly separated from content
- Inconsistent spacing between sections

**Solution:**
- Added specific spacing rules for `.todays-habits-section`
- Set proper padding on section title: `0 0 10 0`
- Added spacing property to section container: `15px`

**Changes Made:**
- `styles.css`:
  - Added `.todays-habits-section { -fx-spacing: 15; }`
  - Added `.todays-habits-section .section-title { -fx-padding: 0 0 10 0; }`
  - Added spacing to daily quote section as well

### 3. Overall Card Improvements ✅
**Problem:**
- Cards didn't have consistent internal layout
- Text alignment varied across different cards

**Solution:**
- Standardized all card VBox elements with `alignment="TOP_LEFT"`
- Consistent spacing of 8px between card elements
- Removed decorative icons that cluttered the layout
- Made card text more readable with proper font weights

**Changes Made:**
- All summary cards now have clean, simple labels
- Card subtitles shortened for better readability:
  - "50% completed" → "completed"
  - "Habits in your routine" → "in your routine"  
  - "Activities today" → "activities today"
